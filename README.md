# Latinx-representation-tv-film
A project to measure the influence/footprint Latinx culture has had on film and television.

Initially, when I came up with the idea for this project I had hoped to use data involving biographies for fictional characters. The plan was to compile a list of Latinx actors, take note of what movies these actors have been present in, and then using character biographies measure the degree to which Latinx have played roles that employ racial tropes; e.g latin lover, male exhibiting machismo, latinx drug dealer, spicy/hypersexual latina, etc. Furthermore, I wanted to observe what words were most prevalent in describing these characters; I was concerned with descriptions for personality traits, physique, and backstory. Unfortunately, the data that I was looking for did not exist. What I did have access to was quotes compiled by IMDb--Internet Movie Database. Using this data, I instead measured the influence and presence of Latinx culture in film and television. I compiled a list of basic Spanish vocabulary, words of prejudice geared toward Latinx, and foods commonly associated with Latinx. By measuring the frequency of these words at different decades, I was able to get a rough understanding of the on-screen identity that was being constructed for Latinx. 

I want to mention that the list I compiled was initially much larger as I was optimistic and naive. I included more than just Cuba(n), Puerto Ric(a/n), and Mexic(o/an) but after some basic investigation of the quotes file, I observed that many of the other nationalities/countries were not present. I had hoped to include cuisine specific to many different Latinx countries but once again they were not present. The only foods that ended up being statistically significant were tacos and burritos, as they have become popular in America and are closely associated with Mexican culture despite the fact that these foods aren't a staple in Mexican cuisine.
