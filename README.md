# Latinx-representation-tv-film
A project to measure the influence/footprint Latinx culture has had on film and television.
Initially, when I came up with the idea for this project I had hoped to use data involving character biographies. The plan was to compile a list of Latinx actors, take note of what movies these actors have been present in, and then using character biographies measure the degree to which Latinx have played roles that employ racial tropes; e.g latin lover, hypermasculine male, latinx drug dealer, spicy latina, etc. Unfortunately, the data that I was looking for did not exist. What I did have access to was quotes data compiled by IMDb--Internet Movie Database. Using this data, I instead measured the influence and presence of Latinx culture in film and television. I compiled a list of basic Spanish vocabulary, words of prejudice geared toward Latinx, and foods commonly associated with Latinx. By measuring the frequency of these words at different decades, I was able to (or at least hoping to) get an understanding of the identity that was being constructed for Latinx on-screen.
